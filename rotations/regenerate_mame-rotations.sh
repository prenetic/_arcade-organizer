#Simple script to rebuild cached rotation information from MAME
#
#Instuctions:
#This is _only_ used by _arcade-organizer devs to build a 
#cached copy of mame-rotations.txt
#Which is then used at runtime for organizing the MRA files by the 
#native rotation of the screen
#
#It will clone the latest MAME repo, and then look in the MAME drivers folder
#and extract the rotational information, and cache it to a file in the local
#folder called mame-rotations.txt.  
#The intention is for this file to be committed to the organizer repo on rare occasions
#i.e. https://github.com/MAME-GETTER/_arcade-organizer
#
# by @j6wbs 2020
#
#You should back up your _Arcade directory before running this script.
#USE AT YOUR OWN RISK - THIS COMES WITHOUT WARRANTE AND MAY NEUTER EVERYTHING.
